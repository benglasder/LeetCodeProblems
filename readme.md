The purpose of this repo is to practice data structures and other topics I never learned about in-depth

In addition, this project is allowing me to practice writing unit tests.

The project contains solutions written by myself, as well as other solutions written by users on 
LeetCode. I try my best to figure out the solution by myself first, then turn to other submissions when 
I get stumped. 

I will add additional comments for my purpose to the other submissions so I can remember/ understand how 
they work.
